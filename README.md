This repo includes all the sketches I made using anything other than Unity.
Tools I used in this project includes:
- Processing
- p5.js
- matter.js
- d3.js
- rita.js

*I might forget something, will keep updating*

Resources and tutorials I referenced heavily:
- Nature of Code by *Daniel Shiffman*
- *Coding Train* on Youtube
- Catlike Coding by *Jasper Flick*

# This repo
For simplicity, I used instagram for visual documentation/reference.
My goal is to have a more serious project page for many reasons.
For one, the interactive sketches really should be played rather than watched.

# Plans *(or wishes)*
- clean up older sketches
  * center the canvas
  * sequence of the animations, some are really messy...
  * hint for interaction
  * organize the code, commenting etc. This is unlikely to happen:P
- translating Processing sketches to p5
- make a gallery on the project website
- figuring out a way to document the unity projects
