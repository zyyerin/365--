		<h1>Project 365--</h1>
		<p>2017 â€“ 2019 | In developing a visual language through programing</p>
		<p>Technology used to realize a design has significant impact on the look of the result for its embedded presets. Programming makes it possible to construct design with logics and semantics. It allows me to think about visuals in a different way. A square becomes a collection of its size, position, fill, stroke, and movements. Rendering produced under such clear instructions are often abstract, complicated, even incomprehensible.</p>
		<p>This documentation of daily coding practices shows the process of me learning and experimenting with new tools. Programming opens up new possibilities in visualization and more explorations need to be done.</p>
